GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | Your honor maintained, even in your darkest hour...#The end of the Alkari Sovereignty has come to pass. Though your people were able to overcome unspeakable horrors during the wars of the Crimson Millennium, it seems they at last met their match when confronted with the savagery borne of your rival empires. Bravely your people fought, with all the valor and honor they inherited from your ancient ancestors. But for them and for you, Spire King, the story now comes to an end.#Perhaps it was fated for things to end this way: your people fought with honor and for the glory of their king, while your enemies made use of any tactic available to them, no matter how crass or dishonorable. Though your enemies may have triumphed, your people remained valorous until the very end. At least history will say that of the Alkari when it remembers them...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | Glory to the Spire King! Glory to the Sovereignty!#Victory is yours! The feeble opponents that sought to impede your inevitable domination were no match for the might of your fleets and the determination of your people! In winning battle after battle, you solidified your position as the true ruler of the Alkari in the eyes of your people. Never again will anyone dare to threaten your empire, and never again will your people doubt your divine right to rule!#In conquering your rivals, you have also given your people paths desperately needed to win honor for themselves and their families and to move up and down the societal hierarchy as appropriate for their deeds. With these avenues open, the instability that plagued the Alkari since the end of the Crimson Millennium have at last been rectified. But once your people spread to every corner of the galaxy, a lack of enemies for your people to prove themselves against may cause tensions to arise again. Ensure that you are ready to conquer other galaxies by that time, Spire King, or the consequences could be more terrible than those that threatened you this time...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | Glory to you and those who fought by your side!#Never again shall your honor be impugned! As the Spire King of the Alkari Sovereignty, you guided your people to new and alien worlds never before imagined and added them to your empire. You forged alliances, managed interstellar trade, and waged wars against those who sought to harm your venerated sovereignty. When the final wars began and the galaxy divided itself into those who would be your allies and those who would fight against you, you guided your armies to victory and displayed unmatched grace and nobility to both your people and your allies.#And now the endgame has passed, for none inhabit this galaxy who would raise arms against you. You and your allies will enjoy the spoils of an unopposed reign, and future cultural exchanges promise to enrich the lives of all who are involved. Long may peace reign, and longer still may you reign, oh noble and wise Spire King!
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_LOSS2           | Your honor maintained even in the darkest hour...#The fools in the council know not what they have done. In failing to recognize your gentility and fairness of rule, the Galactic Council has instead decided to appoint the [leader_race] leader as head of the New Republic. Your petitions and niceties, your diplomatic expertise, and your steadfast adherence to the principles of honor and civility have come to naught in the face of underhanded negotiations and distasteful power-grabbing: you have been left with nothing in the end.#Now the Alkari must brace themselves for [leader_race] rule. You and your diplomats know better than anyone how despotic and manipulative this new age will be, and you know you will be powerless to raise your voice against injustice lest you face the united fleets of the New Republic in turn. Only time will tell how your people will fare in this bleak future, and perhaps, if you are lucky, the opportunity may come for a different Spire King to sit on the throne when you have long since gone...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | Your honor maintained, even in your darkest hour...#Sorrow has won on this day, Spire King. When you raised your banner in rebellion against the tyranny of the [leader_race]-controlled New Republic, your belief in justice and integrity let you steel your resolve for what was soon to come. You hoped that victory would favor the honorable, knowing that none adhered to the principles of right more than the noble Alkari. But disaster followed in the wake of this decision, and all that awaited you in the future was complete and total obliteration.#The ghosts of your people surely harbor you no ill-will: they thought as you did and would have chosen to die before persisting in a galaxy that held crass dishonor above the noble ideals that the Alkari so firmly held. But ghosts they have become, Spire King. And as the last remnants of your civilization burns around you, you face your fate resolutely, knowing you will soon become a ghost as well...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | Glory to the Spire King! Glory to the Sovereignty!#You have managed to achieve the most unlikely victory! The empires who made up the Galactic Council first denied justly earned right of kingship, then scoffed at your insistence that only the Spire King could justly rule the New Republic. The united fleets of your rivals soon gleefully turned their weapons towards you and committed to what they thought would be a swift and decisive final war. But instead of the victory they expected, you have delivered to them only doom and despair!#Now this galaxy lies at your feet, bereft of those who would dare to impugn your divine right to rule. Your people are free from the fear of living in tyranny, for your supernatural prowess as a leader has earned you their trust and love until the very end of time. Go now, Spire King! Go and spread the Sovereignty to every corner of this galaxy, and when you have taken and cultivated all the worlds that await you here, it will be time to spread your empire to other galaxies that are begging for your rule!
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | Glory to you and those who fought by your side!#Your people's steadfast adherence to honor has always been its greatest strength. Now it is the delivering grace that helped keep your empire from certain oblivion. When you began your rebellion against the ill-conceived New Republic, you were met with little more than jeers and scorn from those who comprised this new, tyrannical regime. They thought themselves united against a single foe, and were all too happy to engage in what would become their final war. They thought they would fight a single, misguided foe. They were wrong.#To their surprise, you did not wage war alone. Instead you stood strong alongside friends with whom your impeccable valor and nobility resonated. Together you achieved victories in quick succession, and in short order it was the banners of you and your allies that were soon raised over the worlds that comprised the short-lived New Republic. All that is left for you now is to enjoy the spoils of a shared victory, and to enjoy the fruits of well-earned peace and prosperity. The future of your empire is bright now, Spire King: you and your people have earned nothing less! 
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_ALLIANCE_WIN2   | Honor and cunning have won you the day...#As you traveled throughout the galaxy, you encountered numerous races who achieved varying levels of civility. Though their rude and blunt natures initially offended your refined sensibilities, you sensed in most of them a genuine nature, and knew that it would be your role to help nurture these comparatively base cultures into something more refined. As time went on, it became apparent that they would never be directly receptive to what they saw as the haughty manner in which you operated. But you, patient and cunning Spire King, saw a new way to help guide them and shape the future of the galaxy to your ends.#By helping to cultivate the [leader_race] civilization and entering an alliance with their leaders, you were able to help them rise above the rabble of other empires and become the rulers of the New Republic. As this united force of diverse empires becomes more powerful, you will assume the role of confidant to the new ruler, and help ensure that your values will dominate the galaxy one edict at a time. Once these people have been made to see the light, the peace and nobility you so dearly cherish will finally be achieved. At least it will, if all goes according to your plans...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_WIN2            | Glory to the Spire King! Glory to the Sovereignty!#Now at last comes your finest hour! The old age has finally ended, giving way to a new and glorious future! When the idea of the New Republic was first brought to the floors of the Galactic Council chambers, intense deliberations began on who best to lead the galaxy in this most ambitious endeavor. But you, Spire King, knew that it was a destiny you and you alone were born to fulfill.#Your allies fervently asserted that you were the only candidate worthy of this station. They had repeatedly bore witness to your displays of nobility, your adherence to honor, and the air of justice that you and only you  continuously displayed. In the end, they fought to support your ascension, and now you sit as both the Spire King of the Alkari Sovereignty and the Master of the New Republic. You alone will chart the course this galaxy will follow, and you alone will shoulder the responsibilities of guiding it along that path. The only question left to answer, wisest and noblest of leaders, is what future exactly will you guide this galaxy to?
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_WIN2   | Glory to you and those who fought by your side!#Neither your honor nor your divine right to rule this galaxy will ever again be doubted by those who now serve you! It was an inevitability that you would come to ascend the throne of the New Republic: no other ruler could hope to compare to the sense of justice and regality you displayed, and no people could hope to match the devotion to honor and truth that your people so steadfastly adhered to. When a rebellion began shortly after the glorious coronation day, shock and disbelief rang through every corner of your empire. Decisively, you took your first action as Master of the New Republic and moved to crush this rebellion before it disrupted your rule any further than it already had. Needless to say, you were victorious in the end.#With masterful cunning and noble poise, you led the united fleets of the New Republic to one victory after another. With each battle won and each world conquered, your reputation grew to the level it deserved, and the confidence in your abilities surged to heights that solidified your claim to the throne. The rebellion is now only a distant memory. As your allies salute you with respect and revel in this shared victory, you turn your mind towards the future, and all the wonder and glory that lies in store for your people, and of course, for you...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_LOSS2  | Your honor maintained, even in your darkest hour...#To claim the leadership of the New Republic and lead the galaxy according to the principles of honor and respect was to be the highest achievement of the Alkari Sovereignty. When rumors of the rebellion by dissident factions first began, you thought it best to not give such traitorous musings the dignity of a royal response. But as the rebellion grew in size and your former rival empires declared war against you, you were forced to consider that your previous decision may not have been the wisest course of action. Indeed, it proved to result in your total defeat at the hand of uncouth savages, and the New Republic under your leadership has come to a swift and decisive end.#The fact that this is what came to pass instead is a disgrace that you never thought you would be forced to bear. Your glorious reign as Spire King led you to the heights of power, but now it has come to an end as your foes run roughshod over the worlds of not only your people, but your formerly staunch allies. Had you been more decisive, perhaps this would have been a different ending to the story of you and your people. Alas, Spire King, that you will never know what may have come to be...
