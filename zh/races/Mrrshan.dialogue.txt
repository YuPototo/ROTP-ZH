CONTACT_AGGRESSIVE         | 向你问好，奇怪的生物。我是[my_race]的一员，黄金可汗的仆人。希望你足够强大，[your_race]，不只是为了保护你的同类，也是为了保护你珍视的财宝。
CONTACT_RUTHLESS           | [your_race]，我们是[my_race]。我们只相信一个准则：弱肉强食。如果你不理解这句话的意思，我们很快就会让你知道。
CONTACT_XENOPHOBIC         | 祈祷黄金可汗会喜欢你们吧，[your_race]。如果引发了他的愤怒，他会立刻命令[my_race]的舰队把你碾压。

//
GREETING_01                | 你们一次次地证明了自己。我们也会很荣幸地证明自己。
GREETING_04                | 我会倾听你的诉求，但我不一定能给你你想要的东西。
GREETING_07                | 敢于接近可汗的仆人，证明你是有些胆子的。说出你想干嘛吧，如果我觉得你在浪费我时间，那你得正准备好逃跑了。

//
DECLAREWAR_HATE_01         | 你的宝物被你糟蹋了！我们会用你的骨头和你的财宝来装饰菲利亚斯的大厅。当战争结束时，这些东西将成为你们种族的唯一遗物！
DECLAREWAR_HATE_02         | 够了！单纯的袭击并不足以展示我们对你们种族的敌意：你们[your_race_plural]应该受到更大规模的攻击！
DECLAREWAR_HATE_03         | 像你这样弱小的种族在这个宇宙中也能有影响，这让我们作呕。我向你保证，我们会教你摆正自己的位置。

//
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_01      | 汗国的利爪需要磨砺，大使。你的人民要做好准备了，我们的狩猎需要有价值的对手。
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_02      | 你的人民确实拥有一些最美丽的宝藏，[your_race]。 我们迫不及待地想看看你会为了留住它们而战斗！
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_03      | 我们已经很久没有带回传奇战利品了。你们很会战斗，但你们能防止我们夺取自己想要的战利品吗？

//
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_01     | 强者取之，弱者予之：这是一条铁一般的宇宙法则。你很快就会发现它不仅适用于你的财宝，也适用于你的行星。
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_02     | 虽然它很少像黄金一样闪闪发光，但土地本身是一种有价值的战利品。所有的好战利品都值得为之奋斗，不是吗，大使？
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_03     | 汗国的需求比[your_race]种族的需要的更重要。您可能拥有令人印象深刻的技术，但我怀疑您是否具有与之匹配的战斗力！

//
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_01     | 你选择成为汗国盟友的敌人，这是个危险的游戏。这个游戏很快就会来到一个惨烈的结局！
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_02     | 我们的盟友[other_race_plural]是一个光荣但软弱的种族。如果这场战争只涉及你们两个帝国，你可能会赢，但有我们在他们身边，你就没有获胜的机会！
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_03     | 我们本来希望能以一己之力毁灭你们的帝国。现在看来，我要跟[other_race]一起平分荣耀和战利品了。

//
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_01       | 胆小鬼，相比于为荣誉而战，你愿意鸡鸣狗盗！你的行为与你的弱小相得益彰，现在你将付出代价！
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_02       | 冒这么大的风险，却只给你的人民带来战争。你现在感觉如何，[your_race]？
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_03       | 告诉[your_name][your_nameTitle]：窃密是胆小者的标配。你会如此懦弱，意味着我们的凶猛足以让我们取得胜利！
//
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_01       | 哈！在这里，我们把你当成了弱者，但看来你终究还是有些战斗力的！遗憾的是，你没有机会庆祝任何胜利！
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_02       | You've done us quite the favor by bringing the fight to our doorstep! We'll repay you in kind by ensuring your people meet their end on the battlefield like true warriors!
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_03       | I'd avoid arrogance if I were you, ambassador. The fury of our warriors will never be beaten by technology, no matter how strong you've made yours!
//
DECLAREWAR_OPPORTUNITY_01  | Your kind have long outlived their usefulness. But rest assured that you will provide adequate sport for the youngest and most inexperienced of our warriors as they hone their combat skills.
DECLAREWAR_ASSASSIN_01     | I'm not shocked in the least that your kind would act so spinelessly. To assassinate an ambassador is the gravest dishonor you can bring upon yourself, and in their death throes your people will curse your name for ordering it done!


OFFER_PEACE_01             | There's a time for everything ambassador, and the time now has come for an end to our hostilities. Keep your relics; peace is all we desire from you now!
OFFER_TRADE_01             | There's no doubt that the fastest way to gain trophies is to just take them from those too feeble to stop you! But trading can be an acceptable way for two empires to gain from each other too. Let's start at [amt] BC every year to see how much we can... gain from each other. 
OFFER_PACT_01              | No need for empires so equally matched to fight amongst themselves when there are plenty of weaker races to pillage and burn. Let's agree to an official pact of non-aggression so that our energies can be better spent on those with easier treasures for the taking! 
OFFER_ALLIANCE_01          | I come to you today to propose a formal alliance between the Khanate and the [your_empire]. I trust you will waste no time in signing this treaty? Remember too: an equal share in an alliance means an equal share in the spoils of war! 
 
WARN_TRESPASSING_01        | Unless your ships are in the [system] system to deliver tribute, I suggest you order them to turn around and leave as soon as possible. 
WARN_EXPANSION_01          | While we prefer valuables we can adorn the walls of our temples with, we're not so blind as to ignore the treasure that is unclaimed land. Check your expansion or risk arousing our ire, ambassador. 
WARN_BUILDUP_01            | If you're building up your fleets to raid another race, you'll get no objections from us. But until we have assurances to that end, we'll assume your fleets will be pointed at us, and will not hesitate to act pre-emptively. 
WARN_SKIRMISH_01           | That was an amusing little skirmish, wasn't it? Still, these small battles are boring and without reward: if you insist on continuing them, we'll be happy to make a more formal declaration of war! 
WARN_ATTACKED_01           | Ha! Was that a serious attempt at trying to provoke us ambassador? Your people are weak and your treasures tarnished! Cease this foolish gambit before you force us to end you! 
WARN_INVADED_01            | Surely you jest with this meager little invasion of yours? You're fortunate that we had little use for the [system] system, but if you set your sights on more valuable systems, we'll ensure that you can take nothing from anyone ever again! 
WARN_ESPIONAGE_01          | What sneaky games your people play! You will have to put forth a great deal more effort than that if you wish to gain the secrets of the Khanate for yourself. Take your spy back with you and leave, before this game ceases to be amusing. [framed]
WARN_SABOTAGE_01           | Dangerous ploys, ambassador. Had the building you wished to destroy housed great valuables, we would doubtless be washing your blood from the streets of your homeworld. I would heavily recommend you not to consider sabotage again. [forced]
WARN_BIOWEAPON_01          | Trophies must be won in honorable combat, not stolen from the bones of those who were defenseless even while alive! If you ever use such despicable weapons again, I assure you it will be the last time! 
WARN_GENOCIDE_01           | Not a bad decision, to eradicate the entire [victim_race] species and take every one of their treasures for your own. While I doubt you'd be stupid enough to try something like that with us, your capabilities are still quite disconcerting. 
WARN_FINAL_WAR_01          | Stupid [your_race]! To defy the will of the council decision is to defy the will of the [my_race]! We will take your trophies and burn them down to the smallest bauble! Nothing will remain of your kind once we are through! 
WARN_COUNCIL_VOTE_01       | The Khanate has more important matters to deal with than playing political games in council chambers. It would be better for us if you would simply yield to our wishes. And it would be better for you too, if my meaning is made clear.
WARN_OATHBREAKER_01        | Hmph! Only the desperate break the bond of their word. No matter! From now on we will simply deal with you as we deal with others too duplicitous to be trusted. [spiesCaught]
WARN_ATTACKED_ALLY_01      | I can't say I don't see why you'd attack the [defender_race]. Their treasures are so very lovely... but they will belong to us when we wish to take them: they will not belong to you!
WARN_REBELLING_AGAINST_01  | This peace espoused by the council would never sit well with our people. We desire one thing and one thing only: to take treasures from the weak and make them ours! 

PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_01     | Your support in council is always valued, ambassador. The Golden Khan himself wished you to know that your people are a prized asset to the Khanate, and should you wish visit [candidate_home], a feast will be held in your name! 
PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_02     | Did you see that [rival_race] representative scowl? Ha! Let them sneer! As long as wise people like you continue to recognize our power then the Khanate has nothing to fear! 
PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_03     | Do you fear our raids ambassador? Are you hoping that appeasing us in council will keep our treasure seekers from your worlds? Hmhmhmhm, well it certainly does nothing to hurt your chances, does it?
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_01   | Today will be grand for both of our people, [attacker_race]! The [defender_race] hasn't a prayer against our combined strength! There's plenty of treasure for the both of us: to the greatest warriors go the greatest spoils! 
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_02   | Hoping for a chance at some treasure today, ambassador? Very well, I'll make you a deal: assist us in being rid of these [defender_race] pests and we will see to it that you earn a just reward. 
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_03   | It's obvious that you're only in this war for the riches you can take for yourself. But these [defender_race] have pitiful relics, so I suppose if you assist us then we'll leave for you whatever we don't wish to take for ourselves. 
PRAISE_TRADE_01            | Remember when I began our trade agreement? I told you that we would see how much we would gain from each other, and I'm glad to see that the value gained has been mutual. 
PRAISE_TRADE_02            | It's always more fun to fight for riches and head home with ships loaded with the spoils of victory! Ah well, I suppose that this trade agreement is at least a little bit more profitable when you factor in the costs. Be sure it stays that way, ambassador.
PRAISE_REBELLING_WITH_01   | That's more like it! There's nothing like a good fight, eh? And so much loot begging to be acquired... I hope you don't mind that the Khanate wants to join in the fun! 

ACCEPT_TRADE_01            | I suppose we can't loot every civilization we come across. You want to trade how much BC annually? [amt]? Fine..
RESPOND_IGNORE_THREAT_01   | Forgive me for laughing, your threats are just comically empty. Run along now before our raiders decide to sharpen their claws on your colonies.
RESPOND_STOP_SPYING_01     | You found a spy you say belongs to us? Surely not. We would never dream of spying on the exalted [your_empire]. Do what you want with the spy, it is of no consequence to us.
RESPOND_STOP_ATTACKING_01  | Worried about a raid, [your_race]? Don't worry, we have no interest in what you possess. We'll move them now. We wouldn't want to scare you, after all.
