CONTACT_AGGRESSIVE         | 我是 [my_name]，而你是……[your_name]？如果你是像我一样的生命，那你的名字很奇怪。但你说你一点也不想我？这真是一个……令人恼火的遭遇。
CONTACT_RUTHLESS           | 我被称为[my_name]。你是[your_name]？什么是 [your_name]？我不想认识那种说话那么饶舌的人！
CONTACT_XENOPHOBIC         | 当我开始我的旅程时，我知道肯定有另一个像我一样的人，但你根本不像我……你是不同的……外星人……而且很危险。
//
GREETING_01                | 我的朋友！我很高兴你来了！我希望我能提供你想要的任何东西。
GREETING_04                | 陌生的[your_name]在找我。你需要什么，陌生的[your_name]？
GREETING_07                | 你行为古怪，我不喜欢。只需说出你要说的事情，然后离开吧。
//
DECLAREWAR_HATE_01         | 我等得太久了，我一定要找到一个和我一样的生命！如果你继续挡着我的路，我会立刻摆脱你，一秒也不浪费。
DECLAREWAR_HATE_02         | 当我想起你时，它让我感到一种从来没有感觉到的厌恶。我会付出一切代价，让你毁灭，永远地！
DECLAREWAR_HATE_03         | 不可能！我踏上旅途不是为了在银河系找到你这样的东西！我不会继续与你为邻，要么你死，要么我亡！
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_01      | 你的诡计骗不了我！我知道你会在最符合你利益的的时候攻击我！但在那之前，我会消灭你！
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_02      | 你的行为很奇怪，且不可预测。你让我感到的不确定性让我如此烦恼，我为什么要再忍受它呢？准备好成为历史吧！
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_03      | 你为什么要做你在做的事？什么在驱使你？它会促使你有一天向我宣战吗？我迫不及待地想看看你接下来会做什么了。为了我的未来，我必须立即向你开战！
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_01     | 我还没有找到和我一样的生命。但我知道它一定存在。一旦我从你手中夺走你的星球，我将一个个探索，直到找到它！
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_02     | 你对我隐瞒了什么，[your_name]？我不能确定，直到我探索你的每一个星球。我现在将从你那里夺走它们，这样我就可以随意探索这些星球了！
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_03     | 我不会让你隐藏我想要找到的东西了！我知道我所寻找的那个生命在你们的某个星球上。 在你把这些星球交给我之前，我不会罢休！
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_01     | 我的朋友[other_name]对我的帮助超出了你的想象。我很高兴能通过打败你来回报他们！
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_02     | 那些在我的探索过程中帮助过我的人会得到我永远的感激，我会很高兴地尽我所能来感谢我的朋友[other_name]。准备死吧，[your_name]！
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_03     | 你欺负银河系中的每一个人，因为你认为没有人敢反对你的意志。如果 [other_name]会与你战斗，那么我也会！
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_01       | 在我的一个世界中，没有一件事情能逃脱我的视线。既然你执意要做出如此卑劣的行径，我就只能毁了你。
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_02       | 傻[your_name]，你的游戏我玩够了！如果你要抵挡我的军队，你可没时间做这些诡计多端的事情！备战吧！
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_03       | 你这样对待我，是希望得到什么呢？现在我只能和你战斗，不管我们的军队多么不一样！
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_01       | 这是在干什么，[your_name]？你想通过进攻我的世界来阻止我的探索吗？我猜摧毁你会是一个有趣的小游戏吧。
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_02       | 这就是所谓的战争行为吗？你希望你的军队和舰队与我的军队作战吗？那么让我们开战吧：我想要多学点东西！
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_03       | 你怎么敢对我发动这样的打击？！你想要阻止我完成我的探索，但现在你会知道我的愤怒有多可怕！
DECLAREWAR_OPPORTUNITY_01  | 当某事被证明是障碍时，摆脱它的最佳方法是完全销毁它。我不知道所有的外交技巧，但我知道将你从我的道路上清除会是一件简单的事情。
DECLAREWAR_ASSASSIN_01     | 攻击我的一个身体就是攻击我的所有身体。既然你选择杀了一个我的身体，那我就杀了你们所有人！

OFFER_PEACE_01             | 我不喜欢你称之为战争的这个东西。它是无情和残酷的，我们都有比继续这种无休止的杀戮更重要的事情要做。让我们平静地结束这一切吧，[your_name]。
OFFER_TRADE_01             | 我们都带着自己的目标进入了银河系，[your_name]。为什么不互相帮助以实现我们的抱负呢？每年[amt]BC的贸易协定就可以做到这一点，你说呢？
OFFER_PACT_01              | 我在太空旅行中遇到了许多奇怪的生物，其中许多生性好斗和暴力。你似乎跟他们不一样。为了避免未来的误会，让我们签订互不侵犯协议吧。
OFFER_ALLIANCE_01          | 我们的关系对我们双方都非常有利，[your_name]。 我们结成忠实的同盟吧，让银河系中的所有人都知道我们是站在一起的！
 
WARN_TRESPASSING_01        | 你在[system]的存在让我很不安。将[your_name]舰队移出该地区，否则我可能被迫进行反击。
WARN_EXPANSION_01          | 你占领了每一个你目之所及的世界，者会阻止我的探索。立即停止你的扩张，否则为战争做好准备吧！
WARN_BUILDUP_01            | [your_name]，你的舰队已经扩张到令人印象深刻的规模，你需要注意一下了。

WARN_SKIRMISH_01           | [system]发生的事件让我感到不安。这仅仅是一场误会吗？确保它不再发生。如果没有必要，我不想与[your_name]战斗。

WARN_ATTACKED_01           | What is there to gain by attacking me so? Cease your aggression at once, or you'll force me to repay it back onto you one-hundred fold! 
WARN_INVADED_01            | Why have you invaded my space at the [system] system?! Do you intend to start a conflict or have you merely lost control of your bodies? 
WARN_ESPIONAGE_01          | I don't understand you, [spy_name]. You act as though you don't want conflict but then try to steal my secrets? If you insist on continuing this way, I promise to make you sorry! [framed]
WARN_SABOTAGE_01           | You make a mockery of me with this act of sabotage! My quest takes precedence over all else, but if this happens again I will pause my search to deal with you personally! [forced]
WARN_BIOWEAPON_01          | This weapon of yours is absolutely horrifying. To use it at all speaks of what you really are, but to use it on the bodies of another living thing makes me completely mortified! 
WARN_GENOCIDE_01           | How callous! I never expected that you would go so far as to completely destroy the one known as [victim_name]. I will never forget the barbarity you've shown this day. 
WARN_FINAL_WAR_01          | I now see that for me to realize my dream, the galaxy must be at peace. But as long as you exist that peace can never be made real. The answer is obvious: the [rebel_name] must be destroyed! 
WARN_COUNCIL_VOTE_01       | I admit that I'm unfamiliar with the nuances of what you call "political maneuvering." But I do know that by voting for [other_name] you have made a move against me, and I don't forget those impede me so. 
WARN_OATHBREAKER_01        | Is this how you operate, [your_name]? To make an agreement only to break it when you see fit? I knew that you were nothing like me, and your actions prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt! [spiesCaught] 
WARN_ATTACKED_ALLY_01      | Why do you attack my friend [defender_name], [your name]? Find another way to resolve your differences: I will not like being forced to intervene! 
WARN_REBELLING_AGAINST_01  | I do not like the [your_name], and I like even less that you were chosen as leader of the council! I must reflect on what has happened today, and you should reflect on how I may soon be forced to respond! 

PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_01     | [voter_name]! Don't think I take your vote in the Council for granted! Though you and I are very different, I'm truly happy that I was able to meet such a wonderful friend as you on my journey. 
PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_02     | I have never had a need for "politics" in my long existence, but what you've done is a thing that benefits me, yes? Let us talk again soon, so that we may better learn how to benefit each other. 
PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_03     | Your vote for me in the council is just an attempt to have me rethink my opinion of you. However, I believe I may be forced to do so if your actions continue to benefit me.  
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_01   | Yes! I am attacked and my friend comes to my aid! Let us show the despicable [defender_name] that we fight together with an unbreakable bond! 
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_02   | Thank you [attacker_name]! It is good to see there's another who recognizes what a menace the one known as "[defender_name]" poses. Come! We will attack it together until nothing remains! 
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_03   |I don't know what you hope to gain in attacking [defender_name], [attacker_name]. You are erratic and not one to be trusted, but still I will remember this all the same.
PRAISE_TRADE_01            | We have only managed to come so far by working together for mutual benefit. May the prosperity gained from our trades last until we both find what we are seeking!   
PRAISE_TRADE_02            | It pleases me how much our trade agreement aids us both. You're pleased by this as well, aren't you, [your_name]?  
PRAISE_REBELLING_WITH_01   | The [your_name] calls for aid! I will join you in taking up arms against this ridiculous council! You are my friend, and that means you will never fight alone!

DECLINE_OFFER_05           | I do not consider your offer a fair one.
DECLINE_OFFER_06           | It would not be in my best interest to accept your offer at this time.
DECLINE_OFFER_07           | Perhaps you mistook me for a gullible fool. I reject your offer.
DECLINE_OFFER_08           | Your offer does not seem fair to me.
DECLINE_OFFER_09           | I am afraid I must decline.

DECLINE_ENEMY_ALLY_01      | I would never deal with allies of the hated [other_name]

DECLINE_ANNOYED_01         | [your_name] is a creature of much wind and little action. I tire of your prattle.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_01         | [your_name], you try my patience. Perhaps you should speak again later.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_01         | I have heard enough. We will talk again later.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_02         | I tire of diplomatic negotiations. We can continue discussions at a later time.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_02         | These talks get us nowhere. I must take my leave.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_02         | I go now.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_03         | A thousand apologies, [your_name], but other duties call.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_03         | Pardon me, but our time is at an end.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_03         | I have little time and much to do. Perhaps we can talk again later.


DECLINE_OATHBREAKER_01     | I am unwilling to enter into a treaty at this time because you have broken treaties in the past.
DECLINE_OATHBREAKER_01     | You have not honored your past agreements. I see little reason to trust you now.
DECLINE_OATHBREAKER_01     | Why should I trust you now, when you have broken so many past treaties?
DECLINE_OATHBREAKER_01     | I see no reason to agree with someone who has not lived up to past promises.
DECLINE_OATHBREAKER_01     | I will not deal with [your_name] who has no honor.

DECLINE_ESPIONAGE_01       | You thieving dogs, you steal the fruits of my research. I deny your request.
DECLINE_ESPIONAGE_01       | My technology is for the me alone. You have no right to steal it. I will talk when you stop stealing.
DECLINE_ESPIONAGE_01       | Why should I give you anything? Your spies already steal everything you need!
DECLINE_ESPIONAGE_01       | How can you expect me to accept when your spies are stealing my technology?
DECLINE_ESPIONAGE_01       | Remove your spies, then we will talk.

DECLINE_SABOTAGE_01        | I have not forgotten your last sabotage incident. Until you have proven to be more trustworthy, I will not deal with you.

DECLINE_SABOTAGE_01        | What! You expect me to agree when you are sabotaging my [target]?
DECLINE_SABOTAGE_01        | You destroy my [target]. Why should I deal with you?
DECLINE_SABOTAGE_01        | When you stop sabotaging my [target], I can consider the matter further.

DECLINE_BUILDUP_01         | I will not talk of it while you are amassing ships near my borders.
DECLINE_BUILDUP_01         | Remove your ships along my borders and I will consider accepting. Until then I am not interested.
DECLINE_BUILDUP_01         | Your ships on my borders are no threat to me. But I refuse to deal while they remain.
DECLINE_BUILDUP_01         | If you wish to deal with me, then send your ships to threaten others, not I.

DECLINE_ENCROACH_01        | Your fleets intrude on my space. Move them away, then we shall talk.

DECLINE_SKIRMISH_01        | You attack my ships without provocation and expect me to accept? I refuse to deal.
DECLINE_SKIRMISH_01        | I cannot accept an offer from one who attacks my fleets.

DECLINE_INVASION_01        | I do not wish to deal with the butchers of [system]. Make your amends first.
DECLINE_INVASION_01        | My blood at [system] smears your words. I cannot accept your offer.
DECLINE_INVASION_01        | My loss at [system] cries out for retribution. The pain I feel is louder than your offer.

DECLINE_BIOWEAPONS_01      | I will not make any deals with one who would use biological weapons.
DECLINE_BIOWEAPONS_01      | I cannot deal with anybody desperate enough to use biological weaponry.
DECLINE_BIOWEAPONS_01      | You use weapons that cause untold horrors on me. I refuse to deal with such madness.
DECLINE_BIOWEAPONS_01      | The gods abhor those who would destroy planets with biological weaponry. I cannot allow it.
DECLINE_BIOWEAPONS_01      | The pain inflicted on me by your biological weapons fills my ears. I cannot hear your offer.

DECLINE_TECH_TRADE_01      | I have no need of your toys.
DECLINE_TECH_TRADE_01      | Your primitive inventions do not interest me.

ACCEPT_ALLIANCE_01         | I welcome an Alliance with my good friend, [your_name].
ACCEPT_ALLIANCE_01         | I and [your_name] today forge an Alliance. Death to our enemies!
ACCEPT_ALLIANCE_01         | I see the wisdom in an Alliance with [your_name]. So be it!
