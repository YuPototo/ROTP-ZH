GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | 您周密的计划彻底失败了。#你的种族克服了种种困难，有外部世界的困难，也有自身创造的困境。但在宇宙的深空中，你的种族碰到了一个没有任何希望战胜的对手。即使人类在这个共同的敌人面前团结一致，人类的力量和智慧也在各个维度上被超越了。人类，一个擅长创造强大外交关系的帝国，输给了一个无法通过外交去对付的对手。#不会再有地球人的梦想，不会再有书籍、艺术和音乐。人类那曾经在宇宙中回响的充满希望的歌声变成了下轻声细语，这些微弱的声音变成了一曲挽歌，而后便是永恒的沉默...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | 您的计划成功了。祝贺您，执政官！#您多年的准备和周密的规划收获了胜利的果实。只有杰出的外交家能够在与这么多帝国保持友好关系的同时把敌人各个击破。只有优秀的战略家能够带领我们的军队击败如此强大的敌人。毫无疑问，曾经被您的巧舌如簧说服成为盟友的帝国会在他们一息尚存之时诅咒您的背叛。如今他们只是历史书上的一页了，而这还依赖于您的允许。#很快我们将会举行一个人类历史上从未见过的盛大的庆典。人类第一次抬头仰望星空的时，一定怀疑过自己是否是宇宙中唯一的智慧生物。百万年之后的今天，这个问题终于有了确凿无疑的答案。
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | 您周密的计划成功了！#只有傻瓜会认为一个帝国的领导者可以不依靠盟友就实现永久的和平。毫无疑问，你不是个傻瓜，不像那些想把你从银河系删除的人。在你最困难的时候，不是你的力量也不是你的狡诈，而是你强大的友谊拯救了你。如今，你的敌人在阴间体会着失败的苦涩，而你和你的盟友将会永久地享受甜蜜的胜利果实。#这场战斗、这次胜利与最终的和平，将给我们的后人带来启迪。他们会知道，盟友比致命的武器更强大。放松吧，执政官，享受你的胜利果实，你的人民也将永远地享受和平...

GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_LOSS2           | 您周密的计划失败了！#这本该是你加冕的时刻：一场决定性的外交胜利将会确保你在宇宙的地位高于其他帝国。然后，你的希望在最后时刻破灭了。新共和国的篡夺者手下的外交官比你的外交官更有说服力和魅力。毫无疑问，你为建立外交联盟而投入的精力将会反噬你：因为宇宙的新统治者将说服大家他才是真正的盟友，而你的说辞只是为了满足一己私利而吐出的花言巧语。#你的外交目标将从实现自己的理想变成种族的生存。一步走错，你的人民就会陷入背水一战。执政者，小心了，哪怕最小和最不起眼的征兆都可能成为帝国的终结...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_ALLIANCE_WIN2   | Your best laid plans have ensured the survival of humanity.#While different decisions may have led to you taking leadership of the New Republic instead of your ally, none can deny that your superb political maneuverings have put you in a choice position. Due to your unbreakable alliance with the [leader_race] race, you can rest assured that no one will dare threaten the Triumvirate when doing so risks the wrath of the entire galaxy. You've seen %8 and know its power and, as the most primary confidant to the Master of the New Republic, you will make sure that the desires of your people are fulfilled no matter the cost.#In the end, survival is in itself the ultimate victory, and these is little doubt your people will survive in this unknown future. And who knows, Triumvir: perhaps having the ear of the galaxy's new master will prove to be just as fruitful as being the master in the first place...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | Your best laid plans have been permanently foiled.#Whether a strength or a fault, humanity had always possessed an intrinsic need to rebel against oppressors, and that need has proven to be its ultimate undoing. Perhaps it was inevitable when the human representatives failed to secure leadership of the New Republic for the Triumvirate. Perhaps it was a certainty that the [leader_race] race, whose philosophy was entirely incompatible with the vision of the future that humanity had wished for, would prove a foe too powerful for even the enduring spirit of mankind to endure. There are many "what ifs?" that could be asked, but now there is no answer but silence that remains.#As %8 the galaxy, the last defenders of the Triumvirate fall and the empire crumbles to dust. The last glimmer of hope for your people is that they put up a fight worthy of some remembrance: for certainly they know as they die that to become ghosts of history is the best they can hope for...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | Your best laid plans have finally succeeded.#Those who thought you a meek leader capable only of brokering deals have lived to see a day that they most certainly regret. Though even you admit that diplomatic negotiations would have been the preferable path to peace, you know that the galaxy cannot hope to achieve its best possible future if humanity does not take the reins to guide it there. Those who voted against your rightful ascension can take the ashes of their New Republic with them to their graves: mankind will not be denied its rightful place among the stars!#Your bold and daring actions have led not only to the eradication of every other empire that called the galaxy home, but has caused the other two Triumvirs to cede their power to you in fear of what you are capable of. Take your place on the throne now as Emperor [player_name], and go boldly into the future that only you can realize!
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | Your best laid plans have finally succeeded.#"There can be no peace so long as the will of mankind is ignored." This was what you told the former Galactic Council as it betrayed you, and this is what you repeated to your people and your allies when the final battle ended in your victory. Years upon years of delicate political juggling and taxing diplomatic negotiations had been foiled in the final hour, but they were not for naught in the end. Now, you stand ready to take the throne, and you know that those brave enough to join you in your rebellion will have no reason to oppose your ascension.#It was good for you to find kinship among some of the aliens that inhabited foreign stars, for they were instrumental in helping you achieve your goals of wiping out the false republic that built itself up before you. You will happily ensure that they take equal part in the building of this new future, and reap their equal share of the rewards as well. For the New Republic is no more, Triumvir: now begins the Grand Republic! Enjoy its challenges and its rewards: you have without a doubt earned them. 
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_WIN2            | Your best laid plans have finally succeeded.#After countless years, all the pieces are in place as your schemes reach fruition. It has taken diplomatic skill beyond any previously seen to orchestrate such unity among so different and disparate civilizations. Yet through all the setbacks and reassessments of your strategies, you sit now at the head of the New Republic without a single detractor in your midst. With no sign of rebellion on the horizon, the future of this galaxy is yours to shape. You need only direct your supporters to their tasks, and they will certainly see it done.#You will go down in history not just as the first leader of the New Republic, but as the legendary diplomat whose charisma and skill forged alliances so strong that not even enmity between foes could break them. They will study you in the Republic Academies for generations to come, and all will envy the time in which you live, wishing that they had just one opportunity to meet you and see in person the face behind the legend...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_WIN2   | Your best laid plans have finally succeeded.#The New Republic is yours, Triumvir! Your political machinations made you the master of this galaxy's future, venerated by all as a cunning diplomat and a just ruler. People were aghast at the rebellion that rose up in response to your assuming the throne, yet the rest of the galaxy stood united behind you, proudly proclaiming themselves ready to die for your vision of the future. And though many of the bravest laid down their lives, it was the New Republic, not the rebellion, who achieved a total victory.#Now your era of peace can truly begin. Though much work remains to be done, none can doubt that your chapter in history will be among the most important that ever has been or ever will be. Be proud of what you have accomplished, and be glad that you could inspire such devotion from so many different civilizations with different philosophies. Rest while you can, Triumvir, for another new test of your diplomatic skills surely lies just around the corner...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_LOSS2  | Your best laid plans have been permanently foiled.#Of all the blunders to make as Master of the New Republic, it is difficult to say whether the largest one was overestimating your allies or underestimating your enemies. The existence of the rebellion was of little surprise: it is a given that there will always be those who violently oppose change no matter what form it takes. The speed and cunning at which they overwhelmed the New Republic forces was what truly took you by surprise. Outmatched and outgunned, you could do little more than await an inevitable end.#The rebellion is victorious, and the Triumvirate and its allies will die along with the New Republic itself. The spoils of war now belong to the rebels, and it is they who will decide the direction that the galaxy will move towards from this day forward. If you are to be remembered at all, it will only be in your inglorious defeat. Had you been better suited to war, perhaps this galaxy could have known peace and been spared this most unwholesome of wars...
